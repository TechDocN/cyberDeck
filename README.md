# cyberDeck
# A Raspberry Pi-based cyberDeck, with an RFID cartridge authentication system and a custom 3D printed enclosure.



I discovered the cyberDeck community by accident, while cruising around Reddit one day. It wasn't long before I decided that I had to make my own, and that I needed to use some of my basic Arduino know-how to add something cool and unexpected. After doing a bit more research, I discovered the RetroCart work that has been used to add 80s and 90s style game cartridge functionality to some cyberDecks. That was exactly what I needed. I would build a small Arduino circuit inside the catridge that would serve as an authentication method for booting up the cyberDeck.
